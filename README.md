# Federated Learning
Federated learning (also known as collaborative learning) is a machine learning technique that trains an algorithm across multiple decentralized edge devices or servers holding local data samples, without exchanging them [1].

It's a Server-Client based application written in Python to demonstrate the federated learning on MNIST dataset classification.
